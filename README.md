# Apple Stock Price Prediction

This project focuses on time series forecasting. Deep learning models are trained to predict the current prices of Apple stocks.  
The dataset used for training and testing is downloaded from [yahoo!finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL%3B/history?p=AAPL%3B).  

## Tech Stack

**Language**: Python  
**Technologies**: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Sci-kit learn, Keras     
**Environment**: Jupyter Notebook  

## Getting Started  

### Prerequisites
- Python 3  
- Jupyter Notebook  

### Installation

- Clone the repository
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/meric2/Apple-Stock-Price-Prediction.git
  ```

- Start Jupyter notebook
  ```bash
  jupyter notebook
  ```

- Install dependencies
  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```
  
- Open `model.ipynb` notebook and run all cells


## Usage

The notebook covers:

- Loading and overview of Apple stock prices from a certain time interval  
- Data inspection, preprocessing and feature engineering    
- Applying EDA and PCA for dimensionality reduction  
- Model training using ML and DL models  
- Performance evaluation of models  

It can serve as a reference for stock price prediction and building machine learning pipelines.
